# Bob&acute;s drunken walk
A simple and funny random walk implementation with JavaScript.

### Story
Bob is at vacation in Barcelona. He drunk to much "Happy Otter" pale ale and
wants to get back to the Hotel. It is 1:15 AM and the battery of his phone is
empty. He is straying around to find the right way.
We hope he will find his way as soon as possible.
